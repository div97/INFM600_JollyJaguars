#**Baltimore Emergency Calls**#

##**Summary**##
(We will write the 500 word summary here, and include plots)

##**Analysis Steps**##
(Here we will have all the data cleaning, R script and R plot. This section will be mostly code)

###**How we obtained the data**###

We downloaded the Baltimore Emergency Calls data set from https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/Calls-for-Service/xviu-ezkt

The original data set consists of almost 2 million records. We downloaded the data in CSV format, then imported the data into R.

We decided to use a random sample of 50,000 rows for our analysis. 
One team member took a random sample, and distributed the same random sample to the rest of the team, so that we would all have the exact same sample.

**Step by step instructions:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
##Load the data into R
mydata=read.csv('Final Subset Data CSV.csv')

##Take a random sample of 50,000 rows
subsetcalls <- mydata[sample(1:nrow(mydata), 50000, replace=FALSE),]

##Convert to Excel format, so that the random sample can be distributed to the team members
library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(x = subsetcalls.dataframe, file = "test.excelfile.xlsx",sheetName = "TestSheet", ##row.names = FALSE)
```
